My personal website

WEBSITE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION

Link: https://artist-rosalind-80175.netlify.com/

1.
The website is for viewing by potential employers and individuals who might be interested in looking into partnering up.

2. 
Made the website a single page, which in theory should make translating to additional platforms easier
Chose a colour palette based on images of mountains as I found fascinating images of them on Pinterest.

3.
Aimed to give the website an easy to use layout without too much clutter.
Website is a single page and user can quickly and easily use the navbar to move from one section to the next.
