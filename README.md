# Audience
The website is for viewing by potential employers and individuals who might be interested in looking into partnering up.

# Design Decisions
Made the website a single page, which in theory should make translating to additional platforms easier.

Colour -- 
Chose a colour palette based on images of mountains as I found fascinating images of them on Pinterest.

# Problems

- I became too obsessed with gettin my design correct and consequently spent far more time than I probably should have
- The images I had downloaded didn't always behave the way I wanted them to in CSS
- Lack of motivation to work on the site outside of class as I wasn't completely satisfied with what I was working on

# Reflection

- I want to redo my site over and choose a simplier design that better reflects my experiences and who I am. I felt like I was trying to be someone who I'm not.
