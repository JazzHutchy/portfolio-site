# Portfolio-Site: Website documentation

# Audience
The website is for viewing by potential employers and individuals who might be interested in looking into partnering up.

# Design Decisions
Made the website a single page, which in theory should make translating to additional platforms easier.
Chose a colour palette based on images of mountains as I found fascinating images of them on Pinterest.

# Heuristics
Aimed to give the website an easy to use layout without too much clutter.
Website is a single page and user can quickly and easily use the navbar to move from one section to the next.
